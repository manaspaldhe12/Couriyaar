<p id="how-to-use"> 
	Even in the globalized world, we often are not able to get things from foreign countries.
	These may be some documents that our friends or relatives want to send us from abroad, some electronic items, or medicines, or other paraphernalia. Shipping costs is the major limiation.
	We solve this problem by connecting travellers with those who need items shipped. This saves cost for both: the buyer/shipper has to pay less for transportation, and the traveller earns some money as commission.
	Since the traveller is a facebook-friend or the person requesting to ship, or is a friend of his friend, there is mutual trust. 

	<br> <br>
	Warning:
	<br>
	In spite of the traveller and the person being facebook friends, or having at least one mutual friend, we warn the traveller to thourghly check the items to be shipped. Ensure that you follow all the rules and regulations while carrying the items- customs rules of the arrival country as well as the FAA rules for flying.
